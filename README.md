# Goofy: The Revolutionary Language

Language is a key part of any family, community, culture and the human race. Without language the world today would be much different. From cavemen, to the Egyptian use of hieroglyphics, to Old English, to more than 6,500 languages spoken around the world today, the advances that humans have made in language is remarkable and inspiring. The ability to speak, read, write and understand more than one language is also remarkable and expands the liberties in life, especially for young people.

### And with that said

We the, a group of goofies, will offer you a new way to communicate.

*Goofy isn't just a language.*

*Goofy is about progress.*
